# Secure IoMT Authentication and Data Integrity Using Lattice-Based Ring Signatures and Anti-Quantum Techniques.
This project is a Flask-based secure healthcare platform designed for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). It focuses on real-time data authentication, post-quantum security, and data integrity using advanced cryptographic algorithms. The system enables secure communication between medical sensors and cloud storage while ensuring patient data remains confidential and tamper-proof.
